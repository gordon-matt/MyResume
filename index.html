                        Born and raised in South Africa, spent 8 years in the UK, 6 in Vietnam and finally moved to Australia in 2015.
                        My latest position has me working in workforce management software, but the bulk of my experience has been in
                        ecommerce, CMS and reporting solutions (and primarily in the travel industry).
                        That said, I've also worked on a data migration project for both Deutsche Bank and Monsanto while I worked in Hanoi and
                        I started my developer career in public transport (bus monitoring applications in the UK).
                        I also spent a year in the finance industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wherever I've worked, I've always striven to do the best I can at whatever task I am given.
                        I work well whether in a team or on my own. I am sure you will find I have much to offer you and your organization.

                            We have a great many apps/projects. The main Visual Studio solution consists of 183 projects, of which
                            23 are ASP.NET APIs, 11 are ASP.NET MVC projects and the rest are libraries, unit tests and windows services.
                            Our MVC apps are slowly being migrated to APIs with a React frontend.

                                    We have one main application called MyRapid which users need to login to and from there they can get
                                    redirected to one of the other applications.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    We also have a shared application called FormBuilder which, as the name implies, allows admin users to setup forms
                                    and then other users to fill in instances of those forms. This is shared amongst many apps as a sub application
                                    in IIS (using an iframe).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>My achievements thus far (in chronological order):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Migrated our "MyRapid" app (see above) from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET Web API</li>
                            <li>Refactored FormBuilder - This took many months of work to move away from WCF and clean up the code, which was extremely messy and difficult to understand.</li>
                            <li>Migrated all other WCF services to just be in our class libraries.</li>
                            <li>EF code first: When I first joined, we were still using .NET Framework 4.8. The plan was to move to .NET 8. As a first step, I helped move from EDMX to code first for EF6 (still on .NET Framework 4.8).</li>
                            <li>Migrated our "Contractor Registration" app from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET API</li>
                            <li>Created a PDF API - We use ABCPdf. Until this point, each app/library was referencing the NuGet packages for this. This caused performance issues and slow deployments, not least of which is because the several hundred MB of files had to be downloaded/copied each time for each app/library. I had the idea to move all our PDF generating code to one central API and so only that had to reference the NuGet libraries. This massively improved build times, deployment times and saved more than 100GB of space on all developer machines.</li>
                            <li>Spearheaded the migration of all our .NET code from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 8. For my part, this included a large portion of the class libraries, 100% of the MVC apps and a few of the APIs. We got this all done within the last quarter of 2024 while still continuing to develop and deliver new features on the old version at the same time.</li>
                            <li>Entity Framework Core: Due to many differences between EF6 and EFCore, I recommended we do not move to EFCore during the main .NET migration. Once the latter was completed, I was assigned the case of migrating to EFCore, which was a mammoth task in itself.</li>
                        </ul>

                            Worked remotely for GoQuo (travel industry) from 2015 until 2022. The bulk of my work was working on a
                            reporting system I created, maintained and added new features to. I also occasionally helped the Vietnam
                            team with their “engine” for creating travel websites. Additionally, I’ve worked on several other projects,
                            like real-time booking notifications, email reports, sftp reports, etc. for GoQuo’s clients.
                            One of the last things I did before leaving was a complete rewrite of their hotel management system to improve the
                            performance, the UI and the code quality.
